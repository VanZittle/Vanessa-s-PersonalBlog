# module4challenge-Vanessa-s-PersonalBlog

This is a website where anyone can create posts and share what they think. Users need to fill out the main form and next they will see their post. It has included a switch to turn on/off the original bright colors used. To develop this challenge, I reached out to external sources such as W3Schools for the toggle button and internals being previous activities during the course.

## User story

AS A marketing student,
I WANT a personal blog
SO THAT I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.

## Acceptance criteria

GIVEN a personal blog
* WHEN I load the website,
THEN I am presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.

THEN blog post data is stored to localStorage.
